# Shay's web3 lab

An assortment of files and projects orbiting my learning of web3 technologies.



## File structure
- Baby blockchain: A rudimentary proof-of-work blockchain built using javascript (specifically express framework)
- Example sol contracts: A repo of solidity contracts from various sources for the sake of studying
- web3 roadmap: Literally an editable image file (use draw.io) used to keep track of progress and put things into greater context.
